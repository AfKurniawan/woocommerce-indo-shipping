### How to Use

**For WooCommerce 2.6+**

1. Go to WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping. Create a shipping zone and add "Indo Shipping" method to it.

1. Click the **Indo Shipping** link to open the config page.

1. Enter your RajaOngkir Key and click Save Changes. You will see new fields for **Base location** and **Couriers**. If it doesn't show up, refresh once more.

1. After choosing courier, new field to choose **Services** will appear. Select the one you need. Note that some destinations doesn't have express service like YES.

Done! Now you can see the shipping option after entering the required Shipping info in **Checkout page**.

**For WooCommerce 2.5 and lower**

This version doesn't support WooCommerce 2.5 and lower. Download our [older version](https://github.com/hrsetyono/woocommerce-indo-shipping/releases/tag/0.2.1) instead.

The installation step is similar as above. But the config page is in WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Find "Indo Shipping" tab.

### FAQ

1. **Where to get Raja Ongkir API?** Register at [rajaongkir.com](http://rajaongkir.com/) and purchase PRO version. Sorry, we don't support any other version.

2. **The Province / City info doesn't show up!** There are two common problems: (1) Your host doesn't support a feature called "CURL", ask your customer support about this, and (2) Your theme has heavily modified Checkout page; go to Appearance > Theme and download a theme called "Storefront" and see whether you still got the issue.

## WooCommerce Indonesia Shipping

Add JNE, TIKI, or POS to your WooCommerce shipping option. Currently we support only RajaOngkir's PRO API.

This plugin is free and provided as is. If you found a bug, please submit it [here](https://github.com/hrsetyono/wc-indo-shipping/issues).

### FAQ

1. **Where to get Raja Ongkir API?** Register at [rajaongkir.com](http://rajaongkir.com/) and choose PRO version. Sorry, we don't support any other version.

2. **The Province / City info doesn't show up!** There are two common problems: (1) Your host doesn't support a feature called "CURL", ask your customer support about this, and (2) Your theme has heavily modified Checkout page; go to Appearance > Theme and download a theme called "Storefront" and see whether you still got the issue.
